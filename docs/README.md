# NeoGM Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the NeoGM (Neo4j Object Graph Mapper) library.

## Overview

NeoGM is a TypeScript-based Object Graph Mapping (OGM) library for Neo4j, inspired by Mongoose for MongoDB but tailored for graph database concepts.

## Implementation Documentation

As we build the library brick by brick, we document each component with a summary of its design, implementation details, and usage patterns:

1. [Data Access Layer](./implementation/data-access-layer.md) - The foundation for Neo4j database interaction

## Design Documentation

These documents outline the architectural decisions and design considerations:

1. [Architecture Considerations](../architecture-considerations.md) - Key architectural decisions for the library
2. [Project Ideas](../project-ideas.md) - Core concepts and feature ideas
3. [Graph Database Concepts](../graph-database-concepts.md) - Explanation of Neo4j graph concepts
4. [Mermaid Schema Definition](../mermaid-schema.md) - Using Mermaid diagrams to define graph models

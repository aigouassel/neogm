# Architectural Decisions for Neo4j OGM Library

This document outlines the key architectural decisions for our Neo4j OGM library, along with the selected approaches and rationales.

## 1. Module Organization and Dependency Structure

**Decision: Layered Architecture**

We've chosen a layered architecture for our Neo4j OGM library to provide clear separation of responsibilities and a structured approach to development.

### Layers (from bottom to top):

1. **Data Access Layer**
   - Directly interfaces with the Neo4j driver
   - Manages connections and sessions
   - Handles raw Cypher queries and results
   - Abstracts away low-level Neo4j driver details

2. **Domain Model Layer**
   - Defines entity and relationship structures
   - Manages schema validation
   - Handles type conversion and mapping
   - Implements the core model behaviors

3. **Query API Layer**
   - Provides fluent query building
   - Handles type-safe query construction
   - Manages parameter binding
   - Implements pagination and sorting

4. **Public API Layer**
   - Exposes a clean, consistent interface to library users
   - Handles documentation and type definitions
   - Manages error handling and reporting
   - Provides convenience methods and shortcuts

### Rationale:

We selected a layered architecture because:

1. **Clear Responsibilities**: Each layer has a well-defined purpose, making the codebase more maintainable.
2. **Testability**: Layers can be tested in isolation with mocks for adjacent layers.
3. **Understandability**: The layered pattern is familiar to most developers.
4. **Controlled Dependencies**: Dependencies flow in one direction, preventing circular dependencies.
5. **Implementation Flexibility**: We can swap implementations of a layer without affecting other layers.

### Considerations:

To address the potential downsides of a layered architecture, we will:

- Keep the number of layers minimal to avoid "layer bloat"
- Allow for direct access to lower layers when appropriate for performance
- Provide facade patterns for common cross-cutting operations
- Use TypeScript interfaces to define clear boundaries between layers

## 2. Connection Management

**Decision: Layered Connection Management with Multiple Options**

We've chosen a hybrid connection management approach that provides flexibility while maintaining simplicity for common use cases.

### Our Approach:

1. **Core Layer: Connection Pooling with Multi-DB Support**
   - Leverage Neo4j driver's built-in connection pooling for optimal performance
   - Support multiple database connections for advanced scenarios
   - Implement connection monitoring and health checks
   - Provide configuration options for pool size, timeouts, etc.

2. **Public API Layer: Managed Connections by Default**
   - Abstract away connection management complexity for typical users
   - Automatically handle connection acquisition and release
   - Provide sensible defaults for connection parameters
   - Include proper error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Advanced API: Unmanaged Connection Access**
   - Allow power users to directly access and manage connections
   - Support explicit transaction control for specialized scenarios
   - Enable custom connection handling for performance optimization
   - Provide escape hatches for edge cases

4. **Testing Utilities: Singleton Connection Option**
   - Simplify testing with predictable connection behavior
   - Enable easy mocking and stubbing of database interactions
   - Provide test-specific connection configurations

### Rationale:

This hybrid approach was selected because:

1. **Different Use Cases**: Applications have varying needs from simple to complex
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Users can start with simple APIs and access more complex ones as needed
3. **Performance Flexibility**: Support both ease-of-use and performance optimization
4. **Testing Support**: Provide simplified connections for testing scenarios
5. **Future-Proofing**: The layered approach allows adding new connection strategies later

### Implementation Notes:

- Connection management will reside in the Data Access Layer of our architecture
- We'll provide factory methods for different connection strategies
- Connection configuration will be done through a builder pattern
- All connections will support proper logging and monitoring
- The public API will provide sensible defaults while allowing customization

### Example Usage:

```typescript
// Simple managed connection (default)
const neogm = new NeoGM('neo4j://localhost');

// Advanced configuration with connection pooling
const neogm = new NeoGM({
  uri: 'neo4j://localhost',
  auth: { username: 'neo4j', password: 'password' },
  pool: {
    maxSize: 50,
    maxConnectionLifetime: 3600000
  }
});

// Multiple database support
const neogm = new NeoGM({
  default: 'neo4j://primary',
  databases: {
    analytics: 'neo4j://analytics',
    reporting: 'neo4j://reporting'
  }
});

// Advanced unmanaged connection usage
await neogm.withConnection(async (connection) => {
  // Direct connection usage
});
```

## 3. Transaction Handling Approach

**Decision: Hybrid Transaction Management**

We've chosen a hybrid transaction handling approach that balances simplicity with power by offering multiple levels of control.

### Our Approach:

1. **Implicit Transactions by Default**
   - Single operations automatically use their own transactions
   - Automatic commit on success, rollback on error
   - No explicit transaction management needed for simple cases
   - Simple and safe for beginners

2. **Explicit Transaction API**
   - Support for explicit transaction boundaries
   - Transaction blocks with automatic resource management
   - Manual transaction control when needed
   - Type-safe transaction context

3. **Middleware and Hooks**
   - Pre/post transaction hooks for cross-cutting concerns
   - Support for logging, metrics, and monitoring
   - Extension points for custom transaction behaviors
   - Chainable middleware pattern

4. **Isolation Level Support**
   - Expose Neo4j's supported isolation levels
   - Documentation on performance and consistency tradeoffs
   - Sensible defaults with option to override

### Rationale:

This hybrid approach was selected because:

1. **Progressive Complexity**: Simple operations remain simple, complex operations are possible
2. **Developer Experience**: Developers don't need to think about transactions for basic operations
3. **Safety**: Reduces risk of transaction leaks while enabling power when needed
4. **Flexibility**: Accommodates both simple apps and complex enterprise scenarios
5. **Performance**: Allows optimization of transaction usage when necessary

### Implementation Notes:

- Transaction management will reside in the Data Access Layer
- Public API will provide simplified transaction interfaces
- All transaction operations will be Promise-based
- Error handling will be consistent across transaction styles
- Detailed logging will be available for transaction debugging

### Example Usage:

```typescript
// 1. Implicit transactions (simple case)
const user = await User.create({ name: 'Alice' });
const post = await Post.create({ title: 'Hello' });
await user.createRelationshipTo(post, 'AUTHORED');

// 2. Transaction block (grouped operations)
await neogm.transaction(async (session) => {
  const user = await User.create({ name: 'Bob' }, { session });
  const post = await Post.create({ title: 'World' }, { session });
  await user.createRelationshipTo(post, 'AUTHORED', { session });
  // Auto-commits on success, rolls back on error
});

// 3. Explicit transaction control
const tx = await neogm.beginTransaction();
try {
  const user = await User.create({ name: 'Charlie' }, { transaction: tx });
  const post = await Post.create({ title: 'Neo4j' }, { transaction: tx });
  await user.createRelationshipTo(post, 'AUTHORED', { transaction: tx });
  await tx.commit();
} catch (error) {
  await tx.rollback();
  throw error;
}

// 4. With isolation level and read/write mode
await neogm.transaction({
  isolationLevel: 'READ_COMMITTED',
  readOnly: true
}, async (session) => {
  const users = await User.find({ active: true }, { session });
  return users;
});

// 5. With middleware/hooks
neogm.use(async (tx, next) => {
  console.time('transaction');
  try {
    const result = await next();
    console.timeEnd('transaction');
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.timeEnd('transaction');
    console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
});
```

## 4. Synchronous vs Asynchronous API Design

**Decision: Promise-based Asynchronous API**

We've chosen to implement a Promise-based asynchronous API for our Neo4j OGM library.

### Our Approach:

1. **Promise-based Core**
   - All database operations will return Promises
   - Full support for async/await syntax
   - Chain-friendly for complex operations
   - Proper error propagation through Promise rejections

2. **Async by Default**
   - All I/O operations (queries, transactions, etc.) will be asynchronous
   - No blocking synchronous operations that could impact performance
   - Consistent async pattern throughout the API

3. **Batch Operations**
   - Support for batching multiple operations
   - Efficient handling of concurrent operations
   - Promise.all() compatible return values

4. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Leverage TypeScript for better Promise typing
   - Use generics to provide type-safe Promise resolutions
   - Proper typing for async methods and their returns

### Rationale:

We selected a Promise-based API because:

1. **Modern JavaScript Standard**: Promises are the standard for async operations in modern JavaScript
2. **Async/Await Support**: Works seamlessly with the async/await syntax
3. **Better Performance**: Non-blocking I/O operations improve throughput
4. **Developer Experience**: Easier to reason about than callbacks
5. **Error Handling**: More consistent error propagation
6. **Interoperability**: Better integration with other Promise-based libraries
7. **Node.js Compatibility**: Aligns with Node.js's increasingly Promise-based APIs

### Implementation Notes:

- All public methods involving I/O will return Promises
- We'll avoid callback-based APIs entirely
- Methods will be designed to work well with async/await
- Error handling will use standard Promise rejection patterns
- Where appropriate, we'll provide utilities for batching operations

### Example Usage:

```typescript
// Basic async/await usage
async function createUser() {
  const user = new User({ name: 'Alice' });
  await user.save();
  return user;
}

// Promise chaining
Person.findOne({ name: 'Bob' })
  .then(person => {
    return person.createRelationshipTo(otherPerson, 'KNOWS');
  })
  .then(relationship => {
    console.log('Created relationship:', relationship);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });

// Batch operations
const [users, products] = await Promise.all([
  User.find({ active: true }),
  Product.find({ inStock: true })
]);
```

## 5. Type Safety vs. Flexibility Tradeoffs

**Decision: Strong TypeScript Typing with Runtime Validation**

We've chosen to prioritize strong type safety while maintaining reasonable flexibility through runtime validation.

### Our Approach:

1. **Strong TypeScript Integration**
   - Full TypeScript support with generics
   - Type-safe query results and parameters
   - Compile-time checks for model structure
   - Property type inference where possible

2. **Runtime Validation Layer**
   - Schema validation at runtime
   - Detailed validation errors with context
   - Type coercion options for flexibility
   - Custom validators for complex rules

3. **Schema Enforcement Levels**
   - Strict mode (fail on unexpected properties)
   - Flexible mode (ignore unexpected properties)
   - Development mode (warn on unexpected properties)
   - Configuration at global and per-model levels

4. **Type-Safe Query Building**
   - Queries return properly typed results
   - Property references checked at compile time
   - Autocomplete support in IDEs
   - Type narrowing based on query conditions

### Rationale:

We selected this approach because:

1. **Error Prevention**: Catching errors at compile time improves developer productivity
2. **Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation
3. **IDE Support**: Strong typing enables better autocomplete and refactoring
4. **Safety vs. Flexibility**: Runtime validation provides a safety net while allowing flexibility
5. **User Experience**: TypeScript is increasingly the standard for JavaScript libraries

### Implementation Notes:

- We'll use TypeScript's strict mode for our implementation
- Generic types will provide type safety without excessive type declarations
- Runtime validation will use a schema system similar to Joi or Zod
- Decorators will generate both TypeScript types and runtime validation
- Error messages will be clear and actionable

### Example Usage:

```typescript
// Model definition with strong typing
@Node('User')
class User {
  @Property({ type: String, required: true })
  name: string;

  @Property({ type: Number, min: 0, max: 120 })
  age?: number;

  @Property({
    type: [String],
    validate: (v: string[]) => v.every(email => /^\S+@\S+\.\S+$/.test(email))
  })
  emails: string[] = [];
}

// Type-safe queries
const youngUsers = await User.find()
  .where('age').lt(30)  // Type-checked: 'age' exists and is a number
  .sort('name', 'ASC')  // Type-checked: 'name' exists and is sortable
  .limit(10)
  .exec();

// TypeScript knows the return type
youngUsers.forEach(user => {
  // TypeScript knows user.name is a string
  console.log(user.name.toUpperCase());

  // TypeScript knows user.emails is a string[]
  user.emails.forEach(email => console.log(email));
});

// Runtime validation
try {
  const user = new User({ name: 'Alice', age: 'invalid' }); // Passes TypeScript but fails at runtime
  await user.save();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Validation error:', error.message);
  // "Validation error: Expected number for property 'age', got string"
}
```

## 6. Plugin/Extension System

**Stakes:**
- **Extensibility**: How easily third-party developers can add functionality.
- **Core Complexity**: A plugin system adds complexity to the core.
- **Versioning**: Managing compatibility between core and plugins.
- **Performance**: Plugin architecture may add overhead.

**Options:**
- No plugin system (simpler, but less extensible)
- Hook-based plugins (e.g., lifecycle hooks)
- Registry-based plugins (register handlers for events)
- Full-fledged plugin API with versioning

## 7. Caching Strategy

**Decision: Deferred for Future Consideration**

Caching is an important aspect of OGM design that can significantly impact performance, but it also introduces considerable complexity. We have decided to defer detailed caching decisions until after the core functionality is implemented.

### Future Considerations:

When we revisit caching, we will need to evaluate:

1. **Performance vs. Memory Tradeoffs**
   - In-memory caching vs. external caching systems
   - Cache granularity (entity-level vs. query-level)
   - Cache sizing and eviction policies

2. **Cache Invalidation Strategies**
   - Time-based expiration
   - Event-based invalidation
   - Write-through vs. write-behind caching

3. **Consistency Guarantees**
   - How to handle stale data
   - Transaction-aware caching
   - Cache synchronization across application instances

4. **Developer Controls**
   - Explicit cache control APIs
   - Cache configuration options
   - Monitoring and metrics

For the initial version of our OGM, we will focus on correctness and a clean API rather than optimizing for caching. This will allow us to implement a more thoughtful caching strategy in the future without compromising the core architecture.

## 8. Overall Architectural Pattern

**Stakes:**
- **Conceptual Integrity**: A consistent architecture is easier to understand.
- **Learning Curve**: Familiar patterns are easier to learn.
- **Testability**: Some patterns are more easily testable.
- **Performance Characteristics**: Different patterns have different performance tradeoffs.

**Options:**
- Repository pattern (abstracts data access)
- Data mapper pattern (maps between domain and data models)
- Active record pattern (models know how to persist themselves)
- Command query responsibility segregation (CQRS)

Each of these architectural decisions has trade-offs that will affect the usability, performance, and maintainability of our Neo4j OGM library. The right choices depend on our priorities and the specific needs of our target users.
